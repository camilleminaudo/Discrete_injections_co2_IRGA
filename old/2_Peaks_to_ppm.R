#Peaks to ppm 


#Description: this script uses integrated_injections files produced in the "Raw_to_peaks_..." script and calculates ppm for each peak based on the calibration factor, volume injected and baseline concentration measured (for each peak). It outputs ppm data for each integrated peak.

#Calibration factor used here was obtained following the one-point calibration procedure described in the Licor-application note. Calibration factor should be obtained for each Li-COR instrument, and standards should be treated in the exact same way as samples during injection to minimize biases. Check the structure of the One-point_calibration_factor.csv included in the "calibration" folder to see how you must create your own.
