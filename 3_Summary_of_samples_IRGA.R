#Summary of all CO2 concentrations (ppm)

#This script loads all Licor-derived concentrations in Results_ppm folder and automatically produces 3 files:

#FILE All_Summary_ch4_co2_n2o_allinjections.csv: Contains average, sd and n for each gas without discarding any replicate injection.

#FILE All_Summary_ch4_co2_n2o_best3inj: Contains average, sd and n for each gas Taking into account for each sample the best 3 injections (the ones that result in the lowest CV). If discarding samples does not reduce the CV, the value reported is that without discarding injections. The number of injections is always reported

#FILE All_Injections_ppm_ch4_co2_n2o.csv: Contains the ppm calculated for every injection and every gas, keeping info of volume injected. 

#avg_ppm_GHG: mean concentration (ppm)
#sd_ppm_GHG: standard deviation (ppm)
#n_used_GHG: number of injections used for mean and standard deviation
#n_discarded_GHG: number of injections that were discarded (if any).
